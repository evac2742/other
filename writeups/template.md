## Concept: HTML Elements

<h1>Concept</h1>
In HTML Basics we learn to use elements and how they work. The goal of this is to be able to make websites and learning how to organize how to deplay in a web browser. We were able to test oout different elements in HTML.

We were able to practice HTML with activitys like warm-ups in class, FCC, quizzes, html-make-something, divs-spans activity, coding challenges, and testing out our code in jsbin.


* There are many element in HTML like making the structure. For example html head and body. These elements create the structure of your web browser. These also help you start your code and end your code.
* Some other elements include comments, headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, inputs, divs, and span. Using these elements can help you build your website how you would like it to look.


<h1>Learning Process</h1>
<p>I was able to learn that starting an element always involves `<` and `>`. These are used to start an element and to finish an element. You start to learn the elements and tags and then start practicing with onine editors like jsbin. Then we learned to make little websites in class. After that, we learn more complex elements like forms and input and we practice with them.</p>


<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>One challenge I had faced was remember how to make images. I stuggled to remember the element.
<p>This was the element without the greater and less than sign outside of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>img src="image here"</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to resolve this issue by practicing which led to me rememebering the element.</p>
